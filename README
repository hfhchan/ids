# Ideographic Description Sequences
A list of Ideographic Description Sequences (IDS), created manually or by exporting compositional data from glyphs made under the `hkcs` namespace on GlyphWiki.

## Decomposition Strategy
Characters are generally decomposed according to the principles set out in the IRG PNP.  For example, 嬲 is decomposed to ⿲男女男.

Characters are not decomposed if they constitute separate productive components.  For example, 王 is not decomposed to ⿱一土.
